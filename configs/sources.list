# Neuros Mirrors the Ubuntu 8.10 main and restricted software repos to increase 
# stability.  Universe and Multiverse based software is not mirrored and Neuros
# does not Officially support those packages. Apt-get source lines are commented
# out because the Neuros Link drive is not large enough to make the sources
# usable.  However, the source is directly available via apt-get source if you
# uncomment these lines or browse to the software repo.
